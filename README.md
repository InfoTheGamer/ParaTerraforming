# ParaTerraforming
This mod adds various paraterraforming parts, chemical reactors, and cool trusses for solar system exploration.

COMPATIBILTIY:
Stock KSP; mod is in RSS/RO scale. It's a part mod.

DEPENDENCIES:
- Module Manager
- Kerbal Konstructs (for statics)
- PhysicsRangeExtender (for O'Neill Cylinders)
- TexturesUnlimited (Temporary, will try to phase out ASAP)


INSTALLATION:
- Install the zInfoMods folder into the GameData directory by downloading the code. Any future mods by me will go in this folder, with individual mods going in separate subfolders.

UPDATING:
- Completely delete the GameData/zInfoMods/ParaTerraforming folder and then reinstall.

CHANGELOG:

**v0.1:** 
- First repo! This should only be for alpha testers; as such, there WILL be bugs and you SHOULD tell me about them.

**NOTES FOR ALPHA TESTERS!!! PLEASE READ**
- Currently, only the 1km railgun has a working animation, but colliders are finnicky and will never work. I'm trying to find a fix to at least make the gun barrel have colliders.
- The 47km railgun doesn't have any animations yet and is purely cosmetic. Expect some danger there since it is actually 47km long, not kidding.
- The O'Neill cylinders are still a WIP. Their filesize may make me want to put them in another mod.
- The domes have no colliders on the truss members. Since this is a good way to go into the dome and explore, I'm calling it a feature instead of a bug and a different solution may be in play in the future.
- There are more chemical reactors and plants coming. Future releases may see actual parts and/or working plants.
- You can change the regolith color on some habs and domes with the KK menu. Usually the parts will say "regolith" and those can be changed.
- Trusses are non-scaleable now but I want to add that functionality soon, since my mod is real scale.

**General**
- The file structure is a mess. I need to streamline some things and clarify the organization. Any tips are helpful
- **Please @ me in the KKM discord server or DM me if you encounter bugs, help and suggestions for parts is needed!**
