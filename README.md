# ParaTerraforming
This mod adds various paraterraforming parts, chemical reactors, and cool trusses for solar system exploration.

COMPATIBILTIY:
Stock KSP; mod is in RSS/RO scale. It's a part mod so not too much going on.

DEPENDENCIES:
- Module Manager
- Kerbal Konstructs (for statics)
- PhysicsRangeExtender (for O'Neill Cylinders)


INSTALLATION:
- Install the zInfoMods folder into the GameData directory by downloading the code. Any future mods by me will go in this folder, with individual mods going in separate subfolders.

UPDATING:
- Completely delete the GameData/zInfoMods/ParaTerraforming folder and then reinstall.

CHANGELOG:

**v0.1:** 
- First repo! This should only be for alpha testers; as such, there WILL be bugs and you SHOULD tell me about them.
